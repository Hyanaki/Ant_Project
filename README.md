# Ant_Project


This project was achieved in 2017-2018 when I was student in France.

The purpose of this project was to create a simulator of ant farm.
An empty map with bushes containting food is generated. Each bush has different size. Bigger the bush is, high the food quantity is.

Then a ant farm is inserted on the map. A ant is then generated, her goal is to find food and bring it to the ant farm.
When the food collected is sufficient, a new ant is created.

When a ant found food, the ant emits pheromones on her way back. This pheromone indicates the path to find food to the other ants.


If the food is abondant, a queen is created. The queen will go somewhere else on the map to build her own ant farm.
